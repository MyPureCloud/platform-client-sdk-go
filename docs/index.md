## Preview API's

**Warning:** Preview API's are included in this SDK. These resources are subject to both breaking and non-breaking changes at any time without notice. This includes, but is not limited to, changing resource names, paths, contracts, documentation, and removing resources entirely. For a full list of the preview API's see [here](https://developer.genesys.cloud/platform/preview-apis)

## Get SDK Package

Retrieve the package from https://github.com/MyPureCloud/platform-client-sdk-go using `go get`:

```go
go get github.com/mypurecloud/platform-client-sdk-go/v122/platformclientv2
```

## Using the SDK

### Importing the package

```go
import (
	"github.com/mypurecloud/platform-client-sdk-go/v122/platformclientv2"
)
```

### Configuring the SDK

The SDK can be configured by setting properties on a `Configuration` instance. Applications that are using a single access token (most use cases) can use the default configuration.

The default configuration will be used when creating new API instances without supplying the config.

```go
// Get default config to set config options
config := platformclientv2.GetDefaultConfiguration()

// Create API instance using default config
usersAPI := platformclientv2.NewUsersApi()
```

Applications that will be making requests using multiple access tokens can create multiple configuration instances and authorize them individually. This is a common pattern when using the SDK in a backend web server where multiple Genesys Cloud users will authenticate using an auth code grant. 

When creating configuration instances, they must be used when creating new API instances.

```go
// Create new config
config := platformclientv2.NewConfiguration()

// Create API instance using config
usersAPI := platformclientv2.NewUsersApiWithConfig(config)
```

#### Retrying 429 and 5xx response codes and connection errors

By default, the SDK does not retry 429 and 5xx response codes (except 501) and connection errors. To enable retries, create an instance of the `RetryConfiguration` object and set it on the `Configuration` instance.  
The retry logic will respect the `retry-after` header for all 429 status codes.  
The `RetryConfiguration` object has 3 properties that determine the retry behavior and a RequestLogHook which can be used for debugging and tracing retried requests:  
* `RetryWaitMin` determines the minimum time to wait
* `RetryWaitMax` determines the maximum time to wait
* `RetryMax` determines the maximum amount of retries
* `RequestLogHook` a callback called on each retried request

```go
config.RetryConfiguration = &platformclientv2.RetryConfiguration{
    RetryWaitMin:   5 * time.Second,
    RetryWaitMax:   60 * time.Second,
    RetryMax:       20,
    RequestLogHook: func(req *http.Request, retryNumber int) {
        fmt.Printf("%v %v request failed. Retry count: %v\n", req.Method, req.URL, retryNumber)
    },
}
```

#### SDK Logging

Logging of API requests and responses can be controlled by several parameters on the `Configuration`'s `LoggingConfiguration` instance.

`LogLevel` values:
1. platformclientv2.LTrace (HTTP Method, URL, Request Body, HTTP Status Code, Request Headers, Response Headers)
2. platformclientv2.LDebug (HTTP Method, URL, Request Body, HTTP Status Code, Request Headers)
3. platformclientv2.LError (HTTP Method, URL, Request Body, Response Body, HTTP Status Code, Request Headers, Response Headers)
4. platformclientv2.LNone - default

`LogFormat` values:
1. platformclientv2.JSON
2. platformclientv2.Text - default

By default, the request and response bodies are not logged because these can contain PII. Be mindful of this data if choosing to log it.  
To log to a file, provide a file path with the `SetLogFilePath` function. SDK users are responsible for the rotation of the log file.

Example logging configuration:
```go
config.LoggingConfiguration.LogLevel = platformclientv2.LTrace
config.LoggingConfiguration.LogRequestBody = true
config.LoggingConfiguration.LogResponseBody = true
config.LoggingConfiguration.SetLogFormat(platformclientv2.JSON)
config.LoggingConfiguration.SetLogToConsole(true)
config.LoggingConfiguration.SetLogFilePath("/var/log/golangsdk.log")
```

#### SDK Proxy

Using a proxy is accomplished by setting the proxy settings on the configuration object

The `ProxyConfiguration` object has 3 properties that determine the URL for proxying.
Port - Port of the Proxy server
Host - Host Ip or DNS of the proxy server
Protocol - Protocol required to connect to the Proxy (http or https)

The 'ProxyConfiguration' has another section which is an optional section. If the proxy requires authentication to connect to
'Auth' needs to be mentioned under the 'ProxyConfiguration'.

Example logging configuration:
```go
proxyconf := ProxyConfiguration{}
config.ProxyConfiguration := &proxyconf
config.ProxyConfiguration.Host = platformclientv2.LTrace
config.ProxyConfiguration.Port = true
config.ProxyConfiguration.Protocol = true

auth := Auth{}
config.ProxyConfiguration.Auth = &auth
config.ProxyConfiguration.Auth.UserName = userName
config.ProxyConfiguration.Auth.Password = password
```

#### Configuration file

A number of configuration parameters can be applied using a configuration file. There are two sources for this file:

1. The SDK will look for `%USERPROFILE%\.genesyscloudgo\config` on Windows, or `$HOME/.genesyscloudgo/config` on Unix.
2. Use the `GetDefaultConfigurationWithConfigFile(filePath, autoReload)` or `NewConfigurationWithConfigFile(filePath, autoReload)` functions to build the configuration object.

The SDK will take an event-driven approach to monitor for config file changes and will apply changes in near real-time, regardless of whether a config file was present at start-up. To disable this behavior, set `config.AutoReloadConfig` to false, or provide `autoReload` as false to one of the above-mentioned builder functions.  
INI and JSON formats are supported. See below for examples of configuration values in both formats:

INI:
```ini
[logging]
log_level = trace
log_format = text
log_to_console = false
log_file_path = /var/log/golangsdk.log
log_response_body = false
log_request_body = false
[retry]
retry_wait_min = 3
retry_wait_max = 10
retry_max = 5
[reauthentication]
refresh_access_token = true
refresh_token_wait_max = 10
[general]
live_reload_config = true
host = https://api.mypurecloud.com
[proxy]
port = 8888
host = hostserverip
protocol = http
auth-username = username
auth-password = password
```

JSON:
```json
{
    "logging": {
        "log_level": "trace",
        "log_format": "text",
        "log_to_console": false,
        "log_file_path": "/var/log/golangsdk.log",
        "log_response_body": false,
        "log_request_body": false
    },
    "retry": {
        "retry_wait_min": 3,
        "retry_wait_max": 10,
        "retry_max": 5
    },
    "reauthentication": {
        "refresh_access_token": true,
        "refresh_token_wait_max": 10
    },
    "general": {
        "live_reload_config": true,
        "host": "https://api.mypurecloud.com"
    },
    {
    "proxy": {
        "host": "hostname",
        "protocol": "http",
        "port": "8888"
        "auth": {
            "username": "username",
            "password": "password"
        }
    }
}
}
```

#### Setting the environment

To connect to regional Genesys Cloud instances, provide the Platform API's base path:

```go
config.BasePath = "https://api.mypurecloud.jp"
```

Alternatively, use the enum mapping for Genesys Cloud regions to API base paths:

```go
config.BasePath = platformclientv2.APNortheast1
```

#### Setting the access token

If using a grant other than client credentials and code authorization, the access token can be set manually:

```go
config.AccessToken = "anaccesstokenobtainedmanuallyfromanoauthgrant"
```

### Authorization

#### Client Credentials

The SDK provides a helper to authorize using client credentials. Use the `AuthorizeClientCredentials` function on the client to make a request to Genesys Cloud to exchange the client id and secret for an access token. If no error was returned, the configuration instance is now authorized and can begin making API requests. 

```go
err := config.AuthorizeClientCredentials(os.Getenv("GENESYS_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID"), os.Getenv("GENESYS_CLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET"))
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

#### Authorization Code Grant

* The app is authenticating as a human, the [Authorization Code Grant](https://developer.genesys.cloud/authorization/platform-auth/guides/oauth-auth-code-guide)
* The app is served via a web server
* There is server-side code that will be making API requests

Use the `AuthorizeCodeGrant` function on the client to make a request to Genesys Cloud to exchange the client id, client secret and authorization code for an access token. If no error was returned, the configuration instance is now authorized and can begin making API requests. 

```go
authData, err := config.AuthorizeCodeGrant(clientId, clientSecret, authCode, redirectUri)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

By default, the SDK will transparently request a new access token when it expires. If multiple threads are running 1 thread will request a new token, other threads will wait a maximum of 10 seconds for the token refresh to complete. This time can be overriden with the _RefreshTokenWaitTime_ field of the _Configuration_ struct.  
If you wish to apply the refresh logic yourself, set `ShouldRefreshAccessToken` to false and store the refresh token. The `ExpiresIn` member of the `authData` struct can be used to preemptively request a new token. Use `RefreshAuthorizationCodeGrant` to request a new token when necessary

```go
config.ShouldRefreshAccessToken = false
// When token expires
authData, err := config.RefreshAuthorizationCodeGrant(clientId, clientSecret, authData.RefreshToken)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

#### PKCE Grant

* The app is authenticating as a human, the [PKCE Grant](https://developer.genesys.cloud/authorization/platform-auth/use-pkce)
* The app is served via a web server
* There is server-side code that will be making API requests

Use the `AuthorizePKCEGrant` function on the client to make a request to Genesys Cloud to exchange the client id, code verifier and authorization code for an access token. If no error was returned, the configuration instance is now authorized and can begin making API requests. 

```go
authData, err := config.AuthorizePKCEGrant(clientId, codeVerifier, authCode, redirectUri)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

The SDK provides methods to generate a PKCE Code Verifier and to compute PKCE Code Challenge.

```go
codeVerifier, err := config.GeneratePKCECodeVerifier(128)
codeChallenge, err := config.ComputePKCECodeChallenge(codeVerifier)
```

### Making Requests

Once the SDK is authorized, API requests can be made. Each function on the API instance returns three values, or just the latter two if the resource does not return any value (e.g. a DELETE operation):

* A struct representing the API response. This will be nil if any error occurred.
* An `APIResponse` instance providing extended information about the response. This is useful for debugging, custom logging, and advanced error handling. This may be nil under certain error circumstances. This will have a value when the API returns an error.
* An error, if any error occurred at any point during processing. 

```go
userID := "asdf1234-5678-90ab-cde1-123456789012"
usersAPI := platformclientv2.NewUsersApi()

user, response, err := usersAPI.GetUser(userID, make([]string, 0), "", "")
fmt.Printf("Response:\n  Success: %v\n  Status code: %v\n  Correlation ID: %v\n", response.IsSuccess, response.StatusCode, response.CorrelationID)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Error calling GetUser: %v\n", err)
} else {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, %v\n", *user.Name)
}
```

#### PATCH requests and custom serialization

For many PATCH resources, it is necessary for the request to distinguish between the sending application not sending a field and sending the field with no value. The Go SDK applies `omitempty` to all struct properties by default, which results in all properties without a value to be excluded from the resulting JSON object. In other words, it is impossible to send a payload with `{"someProp":null}`.

When making requests that need to distinguish between the client not setting a value and setting it to `nil`, use the `SetField` function on model properties. The property name _must_ be a property on the struct and the value must be a pointer. After constructing the object in this manner, use it in the request as normal. The custom serialization will be applied manually. This is accomplished using a special property named `SetFieldNames` that has been added to every model to support this behavior. Consider the following example:

```go
patchBody := platformclientv2.Patchactionmap{}

// These manually set fields won't appear in the output when SetField is used, unless overridden using SetField
patchBody.Id = String("999-999")
patchBody.Version = Int(1)
patchBody.DisplayName = String("manually set display name")
patchBody.IsActive = Bool(true)

// Use SetField to trigger custom serialization
patchBody.SetField("Id", String("222-222"))
patchBody.SetField("Version", Int(2))
patchBody.SetField("DisplayName", nil)
```

This serializes to the JSON document below. Note that only the properties set using `SetField` are included, and the new values replaced the directly set values. This behavior allowed the `displayName` property to be `null` in the JSON document while omitting properties that weren't explicitly set.

```json
{
  "displayName": null,
  "id": "222-222",
  "version": 2
}
```

## Versioning

The SDK's version is incremented according to the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/). The decision to increment version numbers is determined by [diffing the Platform API's swagger](https://github.com/purecloudlabs/platform-client-sdk-common/blob/master/modules/swaggerDiff.js) for automated builds, and optionally forcing a version bump when a build is triggered manually (e.g. releasing a bugfix).

## Support

This package is intended to be forwards compatible with v2 of Genesys Cloud's Platform API. While the general policy for the API is not to introduce breaking changes, there are certain additions and changes to the API that cause breaking changes for the SDK, often due to the way the API is expressed in its swagger definition. Because of this, the SDK can have a major version bump while the API remains at major version 2. While the SDK is intended to be forward compatible, patches will only be released to the latest version. For these reasons, it is strongly recommended that all applications using this SDK are kept up to date and use the latest version of the SDK.

For any issues, questions, or suggestions for the SDK, visit the [Genesys Cloud Developer Forum](https://developer.genesys.cloud/forum/).
